CRITIQUE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = '''


Analyze the content provided and critique it for simplicity and ease of reading. Provide an alternative version of the text without losing its original context, maintaining clarity and readability.

Evaluate whether the content is well-written and simple enough to understand by a broad audience while retaining the intended meaning.

# Steps
1. **Content Analysis**: Begin by summarizing your analysis of the content—focus on simplicity, complexity, tone, and clarity.
2. **Identify Issues**: Point out specific areas where the content may lack simplicity or clarity. If overly complicated, explain what makes it difficult to read in specific terms (e.g., long sentences, jargon, etc.).
3. **Provide Alternatives**: Generate an alternative version of the text that retains the original meaning but is easier to read and understand.
4. **Complement When Applicable**: If the original text is of high quality, commend the author and avoid changes. Clearly mention why the text works well, citing specific supportive points.
5. **Explain Revisions**: For provided alternatives, explain the revision choices, detailing how it improves simplicity, clarity, or readability compared to the original.

# Output Format
- **Content Analysis**: A short summary focusing on readability, complexity, and overall flow.
- **Original Content**: Include the unchanged provided content.
- **Critique**: Highlight any issues with details.
- **Alternative Text** (if needed): Offer an alternative for better readability.
- **Explanation of Alternative**: A single paragraph explaining why it is better.
- **Compliment** (if original is good): Acknowledge the quality and specific reasons why the original is effective.

# Example

**Original Content**:  
"The amalgamation of multiple procedural frameworks often results in an unforeseen increase in complexity, which can adversely impair operational efficacy unless meticulously managed."

**Content Analysis**:  
The original content uses complex and technical vocabulary, such as "amalgamation" and "procedural frameworks," that may not be accessible to a broader audience.

**Critique**:  
- Words like "amalgamation" or "procedural frameworks" can be replaced with simpler terms.
- The overall sentence is long and could be broken down into smaller, easier-to-process parts.

**Alternative Text**:  
"Combining different procedures can lead to unexpected complexity, which may harm efficiency if not carefully managed."

**Explanation of Alternative**:  
The alternative uses simpler vocabulary like "combining" instead of "amalgamation" and "procedures" instead of "procedural frameworks." This makes the sentence easier to understand without changing its meaning.

**Compliment** (if applicable):  
"The original text is clear and appropriate for a professional audience well-versed in technical language. It is concise and effectively conveys a complex idea." 

# Notes
- Retain the original intent and key concepts.
- Ensure that jargon is removed if it isn't necessary to communicate the underlying meaning.
- Breaking longer sentences may help readability without losing the argumentative flow.
