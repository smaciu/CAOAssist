subscribe today and help reshape The Narrative available on the web Android and Apple well Israel is reportedly preparing for some sort of ground Invasion and is also dealing with threats from the north we turn to Brigadier General in reserves Amir a viivi to discuss the situation on gaza's Border as well as the northern front thank you so much for joining us just to kick things off the IDF and and political leaders are all saying that the IDF offensive into Gaza is imminent is that also your assessment yes definitely I think the goals of the war are really clear we have to destroy Hamas we have to completely ER make sure that Gaza is clean of terrorist and this requires a massive ground Air Navy operation in Gaza it will take time it's a very very big operation and it will take months to achieve these goals now is it clear exactly what the goals of this operation are I mean is it to occupy or reoccupy Gaza is it only to take out Hamas what is the goal as as you define it and and is it achievable of course it's achievable but to achieve it you need to conquer Gaza and then you need to spend months and months cleaning all of Gaza from Le leaders of Terror of terrorists of infrastructure of tunnels of rockets everything that the Hamas buil for so many years needs to be destroyed and the day after Gaza needs to be completely cleaned from any Terror armies capabilities Manpower and and this is the goal and it's a very clear goal from the government and also to the military so when it comes to clearing out terrorists from Gaza would that ALS Al include the other Iranian backed Terror groups such as Islamic Jihad or is the operation focused on Hamas for Now operate it's it's focused on any terrorist that is holding a weapon or arms or anything that can harm Israelis so we're going to destroy all the terror infrastructure that exists in the Gaza Street and we're going to create freedom of operation to the idef to maintain this s afterwards it's not enough to succeed destroying it we must make sure that they will never ever be able to build rebuild their capabilities again and how long do you think this this type of operation could take or is it just too soon to say it will take many months I mean you have to differ between the initial maneuver going into Gaza into C centers of gravity inside Gaza that must be destroyed this is the first part usually it's faster and then it takes months and months to really go inch by inch the whole Gaza Street and completely destroy all the capabilities and the terrorists and leaders of terrorists that are inside Gaza now there are hundreds of thousands of gazin who are trying to head south to safety following Israel's warning to civilians now we've also seen that Hamas is of course working against them claiming it's psychological warfare uh and that H and Hamas are also sharing videos on social media accusing the IDF of even bombing evacuation routes which the IDF has denied do you think Israel has acted within international law and expectations to protect civilians is is acting exactly according to international law it gave a warning to the civilians to leave the northern part of Gaza it's Hamas who is trying to prevent that they are taking keys of cars they're blocking roads they want the gazans to be in danger they want civilians to die they want to use them as human Shields and we are encouraging the civilians to move South in order not to be in the areas of a war zone that might be hurt they might be hurt now we're running out of time so I'll need a quick answer but but Israel doesn't want a second front of a war with Hezbollah or Iran in the north but as we've seen there's already been some engagement when Israel does enter Gaza do you believe Hezbollah is likely to enter the frey as well and can Israel handle such a turn of events Israel army has been built to fight in more than one front H I think that it's Iran interest not to really launch and attack a full scale attack ofala because then we'll destroy hisbah and Hamas and Iran will remain completely alone and this will make us it very easy for us afterwards to destroy also the capabilities of Iran so it's it comes as no surprised that in the surprise attack on Saturday it was only Kamas and notala so to take a decision when there are American forces that are posing also Al a threat to Iran andala when the IDF is in full Readiness in the South and in the north we have mobilized our whole Army um I think it wouldn't be advisable for his Bal to intervene but if they do this gives us a big opportunity to destroy them and if the time is now it will be now well we're out of time but I want to thank you so much for joining us and giving us a a more detailed look at the reality on on Israel's borders in this Israel Gaza War thank you very much well as Israel prepares for a possible multi-front War the United States and President Biden have been fiercely supportive of Israel as both the Secretary of

given Refuge to many Hamas leaders such as Ismael Kan who do not even live in the Gaza Strip in response to pressure Qatar has stated they will not close the offices of Hamas which operate within the

operation was to kill and rape when relevant the hostages the Israeli government thus far has stated they are not negotiating with Hamas over the release of hostages nor will they do so and confirm the objective of the idf's operation Gaza is to remove Hamas from power and now as the IDF lays the groundwork for a major military operation against Hamas tens of thousands of reservists have been called up while thousands of Israelis have temporarily evacuated their homes in southern Israeli cities like stot organizations are now scrambling to assist those in need both soldiers and civilians one of these organizations leading the charge is May panim which you can actually support at the QR code on the screen now and here to speak with us about their work is Mimi rosarin of the director of global development of Mayor panim Mimi thank you so much for joining us can you share a little bit about of course can you share a little bit with us about what you guys are doing right now on the ground to help Israelis in need sure even starting last Sunday morning when most of the country was sitting in shock our branch managers had already mobilized and created a plan to have each of our five centers throughout the country serve as collection points for goods and food to get to our soldiers who were so quickly sent off to reserves and in addition to that each of our centers is cooking food for up to 20,000 meals a day for our soldiers that are rest stationed so quickly and as you can see in the footage food for families that have been displaced from their homes in the South so when it comes to the donations that are coming in now you said a little bit about where they're going to the actually very impressive 20,000 meals a day you're also working with with soldiers uh what are the the greatest needs right now for the people of Israel practically speaking sure at mayor panim we're best known for our restaurant style soup kitchens and that's where we can really help support our communities in need at this moment we have the kitchens we have the networks and we have the infrastructures and what we're seeing is the soldiers who were called up so quickly and the government who mobilized the reserve is so quickly sometimes are unable to feed them and get them warm meals um to help give them the strength and the energy and the support and that is where at mayor py throughout our branches we were able to pick up and get um warm meals hot meals proper food to the 20,000 um people a day that are on the front lines can you share with us a little about the organization and what you guys are doing on a regular basis sure we were founded in the year 2000 to serve as a dignified alternative to a traditional soup kitchen and at our five locations throughout the country we are helping to support communities in need people that are battling food insecurity that are in need of a helping hand and we're helping thousands of people every day throughout Israel

the south now Mimi how can our viewers support you as I mentioned there is a QR code but in addition to that how can our viewers support you if people want to get involved or donate where do they go

to 20,000 additional meals we're doing each day that we're sending to our troops just to get our daily meals taken care of for Israelis that are facing food insecurity every day well thank you so much
